A simple (my first) landing page about the characters and maps found in the competitive tactical FPS game, Valorant. 

# Key Features
The Valorant landing page is the first landing page project that I ever created and it was mainly to practice toggling between two themes and using grid for the first time. I have not yet made any significant changes since I built it but I plan on updating in the future (possibly with an API that provides Valorant data). For now, the key features and concepts I worked on include:
- Toggling between light and dark mode using JavaScript
- Using a responsive grid system that works on any screen
- Using absolute positioning to overlay text above each character card
- Text overlays only appear on hover for each card
- Styling the characters to give them a more 3D appearance (outside of their card)
