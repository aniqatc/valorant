## Valorant Landing Page

[https://valorant.aniqa.dev/](https://valorant.aniqa.dev/)

ðŸŽ®  A simple landing page about the characters and maps found in the competitive tactical FPS game, Valorant. Website has a light and dark mode, uses a responsive grid and text overlays that appear on hover.

## Tech

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

## Key Features

**My first landing page!**

- Toggling between light and dark mode using JavaScript
- Using a responsive grid system that works on any screen size
- Using absolute positioning to overlay text above each character card
- Text overlays only appear on hover for each card
- Styling the characters to give them a more 3D appearance

## Future Updates
I actually very much enjoy Valorant so I'm hoping I can come back to this at a later time to add more robust features.
- Dynamically load character content using an API
- Implement a popup quiz to find the right agent (and remove the prompts)
- Add sorting options (to filter based on character type)
- Share user data (which characters are the most popular, which abilities are the most used, etc...)
